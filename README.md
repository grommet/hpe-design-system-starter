# HPE Design System Starter
This step-by-step guide and starter application will show you how to develop enterprise applications using the HPE Design System. It is divided into chapters, where each chapter will focus on one objective and demonstrate how to select which components or patterns should be used and how to implement them. The code for each chapter will live on a separate branch that you can access in the [Table of Contents](https://github.com/grommet/hpe-design-system-starter/tree/master#table-of-contents) below.
We recommend you follow the guide from start to finish, but you can also jump to a specific chapter if you have a certain topic of interest.

## Objectives
By the end of this tutorial, you should feel confident about:
1. Building an enterprise-level, HPE application with Grommet
2. Incorporating accessibility-specific porperties to components
3. Making decisions regarding when to use one component versus another
4. Creating responsive layouts that are pleasing to use on both desktop and mobile
5. Understanding the ins and outs of using the Design System
6. Implementing best practices based on guidance in the steps along the way

## Setup
For the purposes of this tutorial, we will be using Create React App. However, the HPE Design System is equally compatible with other options such as NextJS or Gatsby.
If you have cloned this repository, you will see that we have completed the intial Create React App setup for you.
Once you have this repo cloned you can run `yarn` or `npm install` to get started. 

However, if youâ€™d like to start completely from scratch, you can run:
```
$ npx create-react-app hpe-design-system-starter
```
