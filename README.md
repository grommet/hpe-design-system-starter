# Pre-Chapter: We can think of this as a sanity check to make sure we have everything we need in order to be successful with going through this application. 


## Objective
At the end of this pre-chapter, you will:

1. System setup, we will go through everything you will need to start using HPE Design System
2. Basic understanding of HTML and CSS.
3. JavaScript fundamentals (including ES6 features)
4. React


### System Setup

Before starting with any of the code we need to be sure that you have the correct system setup. 

#### Node.JS 
The first thing we will need to be installed on your local machine would be [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/about/). What Node does is it takes all of our JavaScript code and coverts to a faster machine code, in which the computer can run on. 

If you do not have Node.js installed you can simply go to their [website](https://nodejs.org/en/) and install the correct verison based on your operating system. Now with Node there is NPM in which comes bundled with the download. 

####  NPM (Node Package Manager) ?
[NPM](https://docs.npmjs.com/about-npm) is a package manager for Node platform. 
- You can use NPM to add packages of code for your application. 
- Manage multiple versions of code and their dependencies.
- Update applications easily when there are updates on code. 

#### Yarn
Yarn is another package manager that can be used with Node. Installing Yarn is a little different in that it is not already bundeled with Node. However, its pretty simple you can look at [docs](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/#mac-stable) to download. 

### NPM vs Yarn
There is a few blogs on the differences between [NPM and Yarn](https://www.whitesourcesoftware.com/free-developer-tools/blog/npm-vs-yarn-which-should-you-choose/). They both have their advantages but I would recommend going through some [blogs](https://waverleysoftware.com/blog/yarn-vs-npm/) or docs to decide what is right for you.
NPM was the first to be introduced, however Yarn has gained popularity with the performance. Ultimately, it is your choice between npm vs yarn. Both of these package managers will do just fine for what we are trying to achieve. 


### Code Editor

Now that we have our package managers all set up we can move on to installing a code editor if you do not already have one. Our recommendation here is to use __Visual Studio Code__. You can find the [download](https://code.visualstudio.com/) here. Not only do you get a code editor but also there are many plugins avalible as well as 
an integrated terminal. Now there are plenty of other code editors that will work just fine this is just our recommendation. 


### HTML & CSS

Now that we have decided on a project manager as well as code editor we can move on to some code! 

I would recommend going through some basic knowledge of HTML and CSS. 

* HTML is what provides the basic structure of sites. 
* CSS is used to control how the website should appear on the front end of the page. 
* JavaScript is used to motify the content  of websites too behave a certain way. 

I would recomment that you are familar with the basics of these 3 to get started with  React, this will make your life easier. 

### JavaScript 

JavaScript is the programming language that will add interactivity to your elements on your website. There is a ton of tutorials online that will go further in detail about the fundamentals with JavaScript. I would also recommend looking into the [ES6 features](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_es6.asp). 

### What is React

React is an open source JavaScript library. Grommet, which is explained more in the next chapter, is built using React. While having past experience with React is not necessary to developing with the HPE Design System, gaining some familiarity with the library will make the learning curve easier. If React is new to you, we would recommend taking a look at some of the [React documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html).
